## Background


## Goals

USER: wants to know where available passive acoustic data from:

1. a geographic area (radius or box) at some point (or range) in time (min - max)
2. frequeny
    - range
    - sample rate
3. depth
    - water channel
    - source
4. has / doesn't have data
    - strict / not strict (boolean)


For future:
- Handling whether the dataset encompasses the entire time period or not

## Datasets
Starting datasets will be: 
- Ocean Observatories Initative (OOI)
- National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)
- Ocean Networks Canada (OCN)
